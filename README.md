# Automatic-Documentation-and-speech-summarization

The technology of automatic document summarization is maturing and may provide asolution to the information overload problem. Nowadays, document summarization plays animportant role in information retrieval. With a large volume of documents, presenting the userwith a summary of each document greatly facilitates the task of finding the desired documents.Document summarization is a process of automatically creating a compressed version of a givendocument that provides useful information to users. The main goal of a summary is to present themain ideas in a document in less space.

This project presents a speech summarisation system and automated documentationprocess that uses data from speakers during conferences or meetings. It models the speech tocomplete text documentation and condenses the predicted document by summarizing it withspeaker output.Speaker and language are the twoprimary factors that influence speech generation. It mainly consists of two modules- Speechrecognition-speech to text conversion and speech summarising. The main aim of this project is toproduce a brief description of the speech using keyword extraction. Thus the first step is torecognise the voice of the speaker and to recognise the speech signal, this speech signal is thenconverted into text using language models. The converted text as a whole is given as input to thespeech summariser which further cut shorts the given text to brief summary of the speech as awhole.

Models used: Google API and pocket sphinx, text rank summarization algorithm
